No firm decisions have been made, and no code has been written yet, but I'm leaning towards the following technology choices for the server software:

* [MongoDB][mdb] -- This popular NoSQL document-oriented database program seems well suited to my intentions. 

* [Ruby on Rails][ror] -- This seems like a suitable language and framework to use for the server software. 

Client software can be written in any language, and may be proprietary or open-source.
