So how can we improve our situation?

My proposal consists of three parts:

1. A new set of standards that will handle all of the common, modern variations on the basic scenario identified above;

2. Open-source server software that adheres to these standards and implements all of the common use cases;

3. A nonprofit organization to host and run at least one instance  of this software, and to help sponsor and guide the continued development of the software.
