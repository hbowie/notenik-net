A Collection contains a number of Notes and/or other other Collections. 

A Collection is conceptually similar to a folder. 

Each Realm may contain a number of Collections. 

Each Note within a Collection must have an ID that is unique within that Collection. 

The Collection specifies the rules for forming the unique ID for each Note within the Collection. 

For example, the title of each Note could become its unique ID. In a different Collection, the date and time of creation -- or of publication -- could become the unique ID for each  Note. 

The ID will typically be formed from one or more attributes of each Note. 

A unique path for each Note will also be derived from its unique ID.
