Within the context of Notenik, a Realm exercises stewardship over the content that exists within that Realm. 

Each Realm is hosted by a particular Provider. 

A single realm may correspond to a single individual or an organization composed of multiple individuals. 

The Realm establishes the rules for ownership and licensing  of content created within that Realm, and the general rules for accessing its content. 

Each Realm will have a name and a path, with the path typically being based on the name. Both name and path must be unique within a Provider. 

As an example, let's say that I create a realm for Herb Bowie within the provider at notenik.net. So the path for this realm might be hbowie, resulting in a URL of notenik.net/hbowie. 

The null realm represents the realm of the provider. So Herb Bowie might also have a Notenik realm at the url hbowie.com.
