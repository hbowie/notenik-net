A Stream is a selection of recent content that is updated on a more-or-less continuous basis. 

A Stream is conceptually similar to a feed. 

Every Collection has a corresponding Stream of newly published/modified Notes. 

Each Stream consists of: 

* One or more inputs (either a Stream of changes to a particular Collection, or another Stream);
* Selection criteria;
* Prioritization criteria;
* Sequencing criteria;
* Presentation critiera, specifying an arrangement of attributes to be shown in the Stream for each Note.  

Each User may create new Streams, may select Streams, and may choose which Streams(s) they wish to view at any particular time.
