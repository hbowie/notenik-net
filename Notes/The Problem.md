Let's consider a very simple, generalized system scenario. 

1. An author wants to write something. Let's just call this piece of content a note.  
2. The author may want someone else to read what s/he has written.  
3. The note may be intended for specific people, or for a more general audience, or for the author's eyes only. 
4. The author wishes to file the note in such a way that it can be referenced later. 
5. Readers wish to read notes in which they are interested. 
6. Readers may wish to comment on notes. 

This doesn't sound that complicated, does it? And yet, today, all of the following platforms -- often with multiple services and apps to choose from -- simply provide numerous variations on this same simple scenario:

1. Email 
2. Text messages
3. Facebook
4. Twitter
5. Blogging
6. Micro-blogging
7. Slack
8. Wikis
9. Notes
10. Reminders 

Even worse, despite the multiplicity of tools we have available to perform such a simple job, we commonly run into all of the following problems:

1. Spam -- content we receive that doesn't really interest us;
2. Misfires -- Messages that are never read by their intended audience;
3. Lost and Never Found -- Useful content that is difficult or impossible to find at some later point when it is really needed. 

So why do we have so many different ways of handling a single, simple scenario? Is it because users benefit from having so many different ways to do the same thing? Nah. Not really. And why do we continue to suffer from the same problems over and over? Because these problems are so complex and difficult to solve? I don't think so. 

Instead, I would argue that we have so many different tools, and we suffer regularly from the same recurring problems, for these reasons:

1. Reliance on older standards that don't entirely suit our modern needs; 
2. Reliance on companies with proprietary software and services that profit by making us part of a captive audience.
