According to a recent [article in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-tech-companies-regulations), [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) warned of "two myths" that "limit our collective imagination" when looking for solutions to the problems facing the Web: "The myth that advertising is the only possible business model for online companies, and the myth that itâ€™s too late to change the way platforms operate. On both points we need to be a little more creative," he said.

This proposal is intended to address both of these issues.
