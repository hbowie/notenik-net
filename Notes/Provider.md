A Provider is an organization or person that hosts an instance of the Notenik software and makes it accessible on the Web through a domain name owned by the Provider. 

Notenik is intended to be available from any number of Providers. In this sense, it is similar to email, and dissimilar from Facebook and Twitter. 

Each provider is responsible for its own sustainable business model. A provider may be a for-profit or a nonprofit. The provider may charge users for use of content stored by the provider. It may also charge users a fee for reading some or all of its content.
