I've owned three 'Notenik' domain names (.com, .org and .net) since 2014, and have had a 'notenik' repo on GitHub starting in that same year. 

The name has also been used to describe a desktop application written in Java that is conceptually similar in some ways, but otherwise different from what I'm proposing here.
