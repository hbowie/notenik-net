A User is a person who is using the system in some privileged fashion (other than simply reading public content). 

Users post Notes. 

Each User is assigned a username that is at least unique to its hosting Provider, and optionally unique across all known Providers. 

The username is also used as a path for that User's Realm. 

Every user must have a Note titled About, containing a brief biographical profile of the User. The About Note, along with the user's name and general location (state/province and country, at a minimum), will always be publicly accessible, or at least accessible to all other Users on the same Provider, and should be truthful.

There should be a 1:1 relationship between a user and a living, breathing person. The system should strike a reasonable balance between privacy and transparency. We don't want a user's data to be misused, but we also don't want to see user accounts that cannot be tied back, in a singular way, to a real person.
