A Note is a single piece of content. It can be thought of as conceptually similar to a post or a tweet.

A Note will generally have a body, a teaser, and a title. The body is required. If not specified, the title and teaser will be algorithmically generated from the body. 

The body and teaser would generally be specified using a specialized variant of Markdown. 

A unique path for each Note will be generated algorithmically from some combination of the note's title, author, resident domain, realm, owning collection(s), and date and time of creation. 

Each Note will have its own unique URL. 

Each Note may be revised one or more times, and each Revision may be assigned a Revision/Version identifier. 

A Note may be associated with another Note, as a comment or response. 

A Note may optionally have a Date associated with it. This may indicate the date on which some event will occur, or the date when an item will be due.
