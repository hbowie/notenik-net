Title:  Mission

Type:   Introduction

Seq:    6

Body:   
 
This new platform will be mission-driven, rather than being profit- or growth-driven.

Our mission will be:

* To empower users as both content creators and content consumers;
* To inform, educate, entertain and persuade, while avoiding manipulation and deceit;
* To maximize transparency into all aspects of the platform's operation;
* To "smarten up" the content and platform for a group of interested users, rather than dumbing things down to reach as broad an audience as possible. 

If we are successful in achieving our mission, then we will have created a platform characterized by high levels of trust, as opposed to the low trust environments we currently have today.
